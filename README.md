Intro to Github by LOGM
Well, this is my first experience with Github. I mean, I've used it before, but never had to DO anything with it. So this experience is enlightening, to say the least. The last time I really programmed was in 1995 when I was completing my work for EpiVax (then the TB/HIV Research Laboratory at Brown University). Then a bit of web page building in law school, and a bit of macro writing at my firm, but it's been a LONG time since I've used any language lower-level than English. LEGAL English.
